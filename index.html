    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p><img src="images/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture"></p>
<h4>My name is George Sleen.</h4>
<p>I am an Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia, specializing in the electrical engineering stream.</p>
<p>While the focus of my degree is physics and electronics, I am familiar and enjoy working with many other fields of engineering. From circuit analysis to statistical mechanics, Engineering Physics emphasizes a strong grasp of the fundamentals, with clear practical applications.</p>
<p>For me, Engineering Physics allows me to approach any problem from the fundamentals, with a breadth of examples to pull from. This means I can better integrate my specialization, electronics, with other systems necessary for a successful project.</p>
<p>My website serves primarily to showcase my work.
Check out my 'Projects' tab, for a clean overviews of my projects, and the 'Blog' tab for anything that doesn't quite fit in a project!</p>
